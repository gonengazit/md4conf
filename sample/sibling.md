If you are a user who wants to publish pages to Confluence, you should install the package [markdown-to-confluence](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-to-confluence/) from PyPI. If you are a developer who wants to contribute, you should clone the repository [md2conf](https://github.com/hunyadi/md2conf) from GitHub.

This is a Markdown file in the same directory as the [sample document](index.md). This document is meant to illustrate how pages can refer to each other via [relative URLs](index.md#Basic-features).
